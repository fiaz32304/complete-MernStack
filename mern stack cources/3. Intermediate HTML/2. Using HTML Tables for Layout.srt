00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:04,200
Now, the other thing that I want to do with the website is if we have a look at
1

2
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:05,310
Thomas Cormen's site,
2

3
00:00:05,550 --> 00:00:10,550
you can see that he's got his picture on the left and his name and his title and
3

4
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:14,730
his blurb next to that image. And that's quite a nice layout.
4

5
00:00:15,030 --> 00:00:16,530
So we can do that here as well.
5

6
00:00:16,530 --> 00:00:21,300
We're going to have our image on the left and all of this on the right, next to
6

7
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:26,040
the image. Now, because we haven't yet spoken about CSS and styling,
7

8
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:31,640
if we wanted to only use pure HTML to affect how this part of our website looks,
8

9
00:00:33,330 --> 00:00:35,820
then we can use our tables to do that.
9

10
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:41,240
So let's go up here where the body of our website begins and let's add a table
10

11
00:00:43,350 --> 00:00:46,920
and let's add a table row. And inside this row,
11

12
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:51,150
it's only going to have two table cells or td elements,
12

13
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:52,753
<v 1>right?</v>
13

14
00:00:53,660 --> 00:00:57,260
<v 0>The first td element is going to contain the image.</v>
14

15
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:03,830
And the second td element is going to contain all of this up to the horizontal
15

16
00:01:03,830 --> 00:01:07,490
rule. So let's just cut it and paste it into here.
16

17
00:01:09,230 --> 00:01:14,230
Now, we can hit save and let's refresh our page and you can see that we're
17

18
00:01:14,420 --> 00:01:16,670
getting close to this kind of structure,
18

19
00:01:17,300 --> 00:01:22,100
where we've got a single table with only two columns and two cells,
19

20
00:01:22,430 --> 00:01:25,460
this being one cell and this being the other cell.
20

21
00:01:25,970 --> 00:01:29,510
And that allows us to get this kind of layout for our website.
21

22
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:35,210
Now, you can see here that there's a little bit of a gap between the image and
22

23
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:37,310
the text, whereas on our site
23

24
00:01:37,460 --> 00:01:41,060
it's right up and next to the image. Now,
24

25
00:01:41,060 --> 00:01:43,520
if you wanted to increase that distance,
25

26
00:01:43,940 --> 00:01:48,380
then you can achieve that by changing the table's cell spacing.
26

27
00:01:49,010 --> 00:01:50,840
And if you have a look in the attributes,
27

28
00:01:50,990 --> 00:01:53,750
you can see this attribute called cell spacing
28

29
00:01:54,050 --> 00:01:59,050
which defines the size of the space between two cells in a percentage value or
29

30
00:01:59,150 --> 00:02:03,050
pixels. So let's go ahead and add some spacing to our table.
30

31
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:05,270
So inside our table element,
31

32
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:10,360
we're going to use cell spacing and lets set it to equal 20 and hit save. And
32

33
00:02:12,170 --> 00:02:16,280
then let's go and have a look. Nice. That looks pretty good, right?

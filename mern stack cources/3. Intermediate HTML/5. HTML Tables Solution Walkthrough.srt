0
1
00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:02,400
All right. So how did that go?
1

2
00:00:02,940 --> 00:00:05,610
The first thing that we have to do is, of course,
2

3
00:00:05,730 --> 00:00:10,470
add our h3 and we're going to do that right above the horizontal rule,
3

4
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:15,450
which is here and below our table. So right here.
4

5
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:20,070
And we're going to create something that's called skills,
5

6
00:00:20,970 --> 00:00:23,940
and then we need to make a new table.
6

7
00:00:24,870 --> 00:00:29,280
And this table is not going to have any headings because we don't have any
7

8
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:33,900
headings over here, but it is going to have some rows and some columns.
8

9
00:00:34,380 --> 00:00:39,380
So let's make our first row using tr and let's list our first skill inside
9

10
00:00:40,050 --> 00:00:43,890
a td. And let's say, uh,
10

11
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:45,900
iOS development.
11

12
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:50,370
And then we can put our stars in a second td
12

13
00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:55,460
that's going to be right next to our first td in our second column.
13

14
00:00:56,430 --> 00:01:01,430
And we're going to pull up the emoji inspector and we're just gonna add in a
14

15
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:05,970
star which I'm going to copy and paste.
15

16
00:01:06,510 --> 00:01:11,160
And now to save time, I'm just going to copy the row. Now,
16

17
00:01:11,160 --> 00:01:14,670
whenever you're Programming and you find yourself doing a lot of copying and
17

18
00:01:14,670 --> 00:01:19,200
pasting, then you're probably doing something wrong. Now,
18

19
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:22,260
in order to save time, you'll see me do it quite a lot
19

20
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:26,490
and it's because it's not very fun for you to watch me writing tr and td all
20

21
00:01:26,490 --> 00:01:29,460
day long. But when you're coding yourself,
21

22
00:01:29,730 --> 00:01:32,310
ideally, try and avoid copying and pasting.
22

23
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:35,820
And when you do, always make sure that you understand what you're copying and
23

24
00:01:35,820 --> 00:01:36,600
pasting,
24

25
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:40,800
and also make sure you check for any bugs and errors that you introduce.
25

26
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:43,560
So let's edit some of these things.
26

27
00:01:47,270 --> 00:01:52,220
All right, cool. Let's hit save and let's check it out. Looks pretty neat,
27

28
00:01:52,220 --> 00:01:56,540
right? All right. So now let's tackle bonus points.
28

29
00:01:56,930 --> 00:02:01,100
If you've given it a go and you've managed to do it, then really well done.
29

30
00:02:01,310 --> 00:02:05,210
It takes a little bit of researching around and a little bit of lateral thinking
30

31
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:06,620
in order to get it working.
31

32
00:02:06,860 --> 00:02:11,480
But if you haven't or if you want to find out how one might do it, then take a
32

33
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:15,080
look now. Essentially what we're trying to achieve here
33

34
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:17,990
is very similar to what we've done at the top.
34

35
00:02:18,170 --> 00:02:21,500
We're trying to affect the layout by using tables.
35

36
00:02:21,830 --> 00:02:26,830
So essentially what we want is a table that has two columns or two table
36

37
00:02:29,060 --> 00:02:33,470
data cells and in each cell we have a separate table
37

38
00:02:33,650 --> 00:02:37,340
which itself has two rows and two columns.
38

39
00:02:37,490 --> 00:02:42,020
So the solution is essentially going to be a nested table.
39

40
00:02:42,890 --> 00:02:45,770
I'm going to make a little bit of space after the h3
40

41
00:02:46,220 --> 00:02:51,020
and I'm going to create essentially the same structure as we've got up here,
41

42
00:02:51,290 --> 00:02:56,090
a new table that has a single row and two table data cells,
42

43
00:02:56,900 --> 00:03:00,430
this one, and this one. Down here,
43

44
00:03:00,430 --> 00:03:01,960
I'm going to create a brand new table.
44

45
00:03:02,650 --> 00:03:05,890
And then I'm going to create a tr or a table row.
45

46
00:03:06,310 --> 00:03:08,590
And I'm going to create two table cells.
46

47
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:15,190
Now, inside that first table data cell,
47

48
00:03:15,730 --> 00:03:18,250
I'm going to place our existing table.
48

49
00:03:18,310 --> 00:03:21,490
So I'm going to cut it and then I'm going to paste it in here.
49

50
00:03:22,660 --> 00:03:26,230
And then I'm going to grab another copy of this table
50

51
00:03:26,590 --> 00:03:31,590
and then I'm going to paste it into the second table data cell of the first
51

52
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:36,880
level table. So right over here. Now,
52

53
00:03:36,910 --> 00:03:39,340
the structure is a little bit confusing,
53

54
00:03:39,430 --> 00:03:44,430
and this is one of the reasons why using HTML to affect the layout is not a
54

55
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:48,430
great idea. But, by doing this exercise,
55

56
00:03:48,490 --> 00:03:52,810
you do get to grips with using tables, table rows, table datas.
56

57
00:03:53,230 --> 00:03:55,300
And if you've managed to complete this challenge,
57

58
00:03:55,330 --> 00:04:00,330
then you should understand the ins and outs of how to create tables using HTML.
58

59
00:04:01,390 --> 00:04:05,890
So now if we hit save and let's take a look at our work,
59

60
00:04:06,700 --> 00:04:11,700
you can see that we've got a single table with two tables nested inside,
60

61
00:04:13,150 --> 00:04:17,290
and we've managed to achieve this kind of structure. Now,
61

62
00:04:17,290 --> 00:04:21,580
feel free to keep this layout or revert to the previous layout before the bonus
62

63
00:04:21,580 --> 00:04:24,670
challenge. It's completely up to you, or even design it
63

64
00:04:24,670 --> 00:04:27,370
however you like with as many tables as you need.
64

65
00:04:27,490 --> 00:04:31,180
But I'm going to get rid of this nested table because it makes it really,
65

66
00:04:31,180 --> 00:04:34,780
really complicated to see at a glance what's going on.
66

67
00:04:34,930 --> 00:04:39,930
So I'm going to remove this top-level table and everything below this closing
67

68
00:04:40,510 --> 00:04:42,760
table tag, I'm going to delete.
68

69
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:45,640
And I'm going to get rid of some of that space.
69

70
00:04:46,150 --> 00:04:49,120
And we're back at where we were before the challenge
70

71
00:04:49,210 --> 00:04:51,910
and I'll hit save to continue from here.
71

72
00:04:52,450 --> 00:04:57,450
Let's finish off by just giving our tables a little bit more spacing so that
72

73
00:04:57,520 --> 00:04:59,530
everything looks a little bit more spread out.
73

74
00:04:59,770 --> 00:05:04,210
So go ahead and add the cell spacing attribute to both of your tables and give
74

75
00:05:04,210 --> 00:05:06,130
it a value of say 10 pixels.
75

76
00:05:10,380 --> 00:05:13,050
All right. So that's easy enough. We've done it before here.
76

77
00:05:13,140 --> 00:05:18,140
So we're going to add cell spacing equals 10 up here and also in this table as
77

78
00:05:22,110 --> 00:05:27,060
well. Hit save. Let's check it out. Nice. It looks pretty good, right?
78

79
00:05:27,780 --> 00:05:31,230
And finally, let's add a few more horizontal rules.
79

80
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:35,790
So let's add one between books and teaching and work experience and also one
80

81
00:05:35,790 --> 00:05:38,010
between work experience and skills.
81

82
00:05:42,330 --> 00:05:42,750
Okay.
82

83
00:05:42,750 --> 00:05:47,750
So let's find the end of books and teaching and let's add a horizontal rule here.
83

84
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:53,960
Let's find the end of work experience and let's add a horizontal rule here.
84

85
00:05:56,610 --> 00:06:00,710
Hit save, refresh. There we go. A bit more spacing,
85

86
00:06:00,950 --> 00:06:03,500
everything looks a little bit more padded out. Alright.
86

87
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:06,170
So if any of that was confusing or difficult,
87

88
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:11,240
make sure that you watch the video again and also have a read of the MDN web
88

89
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:13,130
docs on not just tables,
89

90
00:06:13,430 --> 00:06:18,430
but also thead or tbody or tfoot or th, th, et cetera.
90

91
00:06:20,210 --> 00:06:23,870
So that you can have a look at the example code and see some other examples of
91

92
00:06:23,870 --> 00:06:27,620
how you can use tables and rows and cells.
92

93
00:06:28,490 --> 00:06:29,570
Now in the next lesson,
93

94
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:34,600
we're going to learn all about HTML forms and how you can add these to your
94

95
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:38,300
webpage to collect data from your users.
95

96
00:06:38,870 --> 00:06:42,170
So all of that and more see you on the next lesson.

0
1
00:00:00,510 --> 00:00:04,080
All right. So I've added a few more details here and there to
1

2
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:05,340
this personal site
2

3
00:00:05,550 --> 00:00:09,780
and it's now really coming along and starting to look like a real website that
3

4
00:00:09,780 --> 00:00:12,570
you might come across browsing the web. Now,
4

5
00:00:12,570 --> 00:00:17,070
the next thing that I want to do is when we go to the contact me page,
5

6
00:00:17,580 --> 00:00:21,720
it's a little bit sparse at the moment. It's only got my fictional address,
6

7
00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:24,930
my fictional number and my fictional email. Now,
7

8
00:00:24,930 --> 00:00:28,590
what if I could add a form at the end of this
8

9
00:00:29,220 --> 00:00:32,400
where I allow people to put down their name and their email
9

10
00:00:32,850 --> 00:00:35,820
and they can message me using that form?
10

11
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:38,570
How would we do that in HTML? So,
11

12
00:00:38,750 --> 00:00:40,850
of course, first place to head to
12

13
00:00:40,910 --> 00:00:45,380
<v 0>is the MDN web docs. And we've got our form element.</v>
13

14
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:49,430
Now you can read through all of these attributes and start getting an
14

15
00:00:49,430 --> 00:00:53,840
understanding of how a form works and how you can put one together. Now,
15

16
00:00:53,870 --> 00:00:58,580
in order for forms to really come alive and to work as you would expect them
16

17
00:00:58,580 --> 00:01:02,750
to, it actually requires a little bit more than just HTML,
17

18
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:06,590
because we need to specify the behavior of the form.
18

19
00:01:07,010 --> 00:01:10,850
We can design the form and we can structure the form for our website
19

20
00:01:11,180 --> 00:01:13,460
but until we learn about JavaScript,
20

21
00:01:13,490 --> 00:01:16,700
we won't be able to tap into its full functionality just yet.
21

22
00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:19,310
But we can get pretty close.
22

23
00:01:19,550 --> 00:01:24,200
So let's go ahead and create a brand new form inside our contact-
23

24
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:28,820
me.html page. Just below the last paragraph tag,
24

25
00:01:29,180 --> 00:01:34,180
let's add a brand new form. And you can see that with the autosuggest
25

26
00:01:35,780 --> 00:01:39,290
these are the default things that come up. Now,
26

27
00:01:39,290 --> 00:01:40,700
I'm going to keep them as they are and
27

28
00:01:40,790 --> 00:01:44,930
we're going to go inside the form tag and we're going to create our first
28

29
00:01:44,990 --> 00:01:45,823
label.
29

30
00:01:46,490 --> 00:01:50,390
Now our first label is simply going to be called your name.
30

31
00:01:50,690 --> 00:01:54,470
So this is where we ask our user for their name input.
31

32
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:59,480
And in order to store that information or allow them to type that information,
32

33
00:01:59,780 --> 00:02:04,640
we need to add an input and the type of input is going to be text.
33

34
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:08,120
So it's just going to be a text box that allows them to put in their name.
34

35
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:13,220
And if we hit save and check out what our website looks like at the moment,
35

36
00:02:13,610 --> 00:02:18,410
then you can see we've got our label here and we've got a box where somebody can
36

37
00:02:18,410 --> 00:02:22,880
type in some inputs. Now the thing that we're missing is a submit button.
37

38
00:02:23,540 --> 00:02:28,540
Now a submit button also falls under the inputs of a form and you can see it
38

39
00:02:30,380 --> 00:02:31,213
right here.
39

40
00:02:31,460 --> 00:02:35,480
It's simply an input instead of having a type of text,
40

41
00:02:35,750 --> 00:02:40,670
it has the type of submit and all you need to do is to change the word text
41

42
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:45,290
to submit and delete the value attribute and hit
42

43
00:02:45,290 --> 00:02:47,660
save and refresh.
43

44
00:02:47,900 --> 00:02:51,920
You'll see that you get this submit button without having to put in any extra
44

45
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:55,310
effort. So that's the beauty of some of these form inputs.
45

46
00:02:55,850 --> 00:02:59,030
And we can check out some of the other ones inside the docs by going to the related
46

47
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:02,920
topics. And there's loads of different types of inputs.
47

48
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:08,380
There's buttons which are inputs, there's check boxes, color, date.
48

49
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:11,500
Let's give some of them a try and see what they look like on screen.
49

50
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:16,030
Just before the submit button, let's add an input that has type
50

51
00:03:16,060 --> 00:03:18,550
maybe color. And of course,
51

52
00:03:18,550 --> 00:03:22,750
remember you have to spell it the American way with a single 'o' instead of
52

53
00:03:22,810 --> 00:03:23,643
'ou'.
53

54
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:28,810
So let's hit save and refresh and you can see
54

55
00:03:28,810 --> 00:03:32,320
we now have a color picker on our website. And when you click on it,
55

56
00:03:32,650 --> 00:03:37,360
it brings up the color picker where we can select any color we'd like,
56

57
00:03:37,660 --> 00:03:42,070
and you might submit a form that maybe has your favorite color or change the
57

58
00:03:42,070 --> 00:03:44,680
website using a color picker input.
58

59
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:47,380
Another cool one is the check box.
59

60
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:52,560
So we can add a checkbox by using input and changing text to check box. Hit
60

61
00:03:55,480 --> 00:04:00,130
save, hit refresh, and you can see, we now have a little check box.
61

62
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:03,640
So you can have a line break here
62

63
00:04:03,670 --> 00:04:08,230
forcing this to go on to the next line. And let's create a label where it says
63

64
00:04:08,290 --> 00:04:13,290
do you want to sign up to the email list, and hit save, refresh,
64

65
00:04:16,900 --> 00:04:19,660
and you can see you've got this classic checkbox.
65

66
00:04:19,690 --> 00:04:23,110
Do you want to sign up to the email list, check or uncheck and hit submit?
66

67
00:04:23,530 --> 00:04:24,550
Or you can put something like
67

68
00:04:24,550 --> 00:04:28,060
have you read the terms and conditions or any other thing that might fit with a
68

69
00:04:28,090 --> 00:04:28,923
checkbox.
69

70
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:33,100
Now the last one that I wanted to show you before we proceed was the password
70

71
00:04:33,100 --> 00:04:33,933
input.
71

72
00:04:34,210 --> 00:04:39,210
So let's delete the checkbox and let's add a password input.
72

73
00:04:41,170 --> 00:04:46,120
The cool thing about the password input is that when you type anything inside
73

74
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:46,953
this box,
74

75
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:52,080
ideally you'd want a label of course here to show that this is the password.
75

76
00:04:54,820 --> 00:04:59,290
But we know this is a password field because you can either right-click and hit
76

77
00:04:59,290 --> 00:05:00,160
inspect
77

78
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:05,440
and you'll see that this is our password input or you know that the next thing
78

79
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:09,400
that comes after the password label is of course the password input.
79

80
00:05:09,790 --> 00:05:12,880
But whenever you type anything in here, by default,
80

81
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:14,920
everything you type is masked.
81

82
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:19,900
So these are for fields where you don't want somebody overlooking the user to be
82

83
00:05:19,900 --> 00:05:21,550
able to see what their password is.
83

84
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:26,710
Feel free to have a bit of fun and try out all of these different input types
84

85
00:05:27,190 --> 00:05:31,960
and see what they look like and see what they do. And once you do that,
85

86
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:33,430
you'll come to realize that a lot of
86

87
00:05:33,430 --> 00:05:38,430
the things that you see on the web are just very simple HTML inputs.
87

88
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:43,000
And as we build our knowledge in HTML, CSS and JavaScript,
88

89
00:05:43,270 --> 00:05:47,620
we're going to come back and see how forms work in more detail.
89

90
00:05:47,770 --> 00:05:51,550
So have an explore of have that and see what they all look like when you just add
90

91
00:05:51,550 --> 00:05:52,420
them to your website,
91

92
00:05:52,660 --> 00:05:55,600
but we'll experience the full functionality a little bit later on.
92

93
00:05:56,230 --> 00:06:00,350
Now, let's just quickly review what we've learned about HTML forms.
93

94
00:06:00,830 --> 00:06:05,830
We use the form tag to define what should go into our form and this by itself
94

95
00:06:07,250 --> 00:06:11,270
doesn't actually do anything. So in order for the form to do anything,
95

96
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:16,480
you'll need two important HTML elements and that's the label and the input.
96

97
00:06:17,420 --> 00:06:19,610
And between the opening and closing label tags,
97

98
00:06:19,820 --> 00:06:24,820
you can write some text that will be displayed as a label inside your form.
98

99
00:06:25,370 --> 00:06:30,370
The next most important HTML element that's associated with forms are the inputs.
99

100
00:06:31,010 --> 00:06:33,890
And the input is a self-closing tag
100

101
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:36,080
so it doesn't have a closing tag.
101

102
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:41,440
Instead, you can define the input type by using the type attribute
102

103
00:06:42,170 --> 00:06:46,940
and there's a whole bunch of input types that you can tap into to use inside
103

104
00:06:46,940 --> 00:06:51,230
your form. For example, in this case, the type is set to text.
104

105
00:06:51,530 --> 00:06:55,520
So we get a textbox where the user can input their name.
105

106
00:06:55,850 --> 00:07:00,850
But you can also use an input element that has the type attribute set as submit
106

107
00:07:02,690 --> 00:07:04,670
and this creates a button.
107

108
00:07:04,910 --> 00:07:09,410
So you can see that by setting the attribute type to various predefined key
108

109
00:07:09,410 --> 00:07:14,120
words, you actually end up with completely different things on your website.
109

110
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:19,480
And it might seem strange that even though we're using the same HTML element,
110

111
00:07:20,180 --> 00:07:21,290
i.e. the input,
111

112
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:25,160
we're actually getting completely different objects on our website,
112

113
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:27,890
anywhere from textboxes, to buttons
113

114
00:07:27,890 --> 00:07:32,870
to color pickers and a myriad array of different things that we can create just
114

115
00:07:32,870 --> 00:07:35,540
by changing that type. Now,
115

116
00:07:35,540 --> 00:07:38,720
aside from just the text and submit input types,
116

117
00:07:38,930 --> 00:07:40,670
if you have a look at the MDN docs,
117

118
00:07:40,670 --> 00:07:44,240
you'll see that there's loads more different keywords that you can use.
118

119
00:07:44,450 --> 00:07:44,990
For example,
119

120
00:07:44,990 --> 00:07:49,820
the input type where you allow the user to upload a file or the date picker or
120

121
00:07:49,820 --> 00:07:52,070
the radio button or a range.
121

122
00:07:52,310 --> 00:07:57,310
And you can see that I've only got static images in my slide to show you what
122

123
00:07:57,530 --> 00:07:58,363
they look like.
123

124
00:07:58,730 --> 00:08:03,730
But I want you to look through the MDN documentation for the input HTML element
124

125
00:08:05,030 --> 00:08:10,030
and I want you to create a new HTML file that you're going to put onto your
125

126
00:08:10,220 --> 00:08:15,220
desktop and you can open it in order to see it live in action.
126

127
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:19,790
For example, the date picker now works and my range can be toggled.
127

128
00:08:19,820 --> 00:08:21,680
I can switch my radio button on,
128

129
00:08:21,950 --> 00:08:24,920
I can choose a file and a whole bunch of things.
129

130
00:08:25,100 --> 00:08:27,560
So use it as a living notebook, if you will.
130

131
00:08:30,700 --> 00:08:33,970
That should've been really easy and just to quickly show you,
131

132
00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:38,830
this is what you could have created in order to achieve this. Now at the moment,
132

133
00:08:39,040 --> 00:08:44,040
we're not yet looking into the other attributes for our form or for our inputs.
133

134
00:08:44,860 --> 00:08:49,860
And we're only changing the type attribute to some of these predefined keywords
134

135
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:55,800
that you can see are listed on the MDN developer docs.
135

136
00:08:56,460 --> 00:08:57,420
In the next lesson,
136

137
00:08:57,450 --> 00:09:02,450
we'll look closer at how forms work and how you can capture and reveal what the
137

138
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:07,650
user has chosen for each of the inputs. So for all of that and more,
138

139
00:09:07,710 --> 00:09:08,940
I'll see you on the next lesson.

1
00:00:00,810 --> 00:00:05,810
Now that we've completed the HTML section and we have our completed website,
1

2
00:00:07,110 --> 00:00:12,110
but we can only access it locally because when we open up our index.html,
2

3
00:00:12,690 --> 00:00:16,800
you can see that we're just opening a local file, right? In this case,
3

4
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:21,360
this file's inside my users folder inside my username inside my desktop.
4

5
00:00:21,990 --> 00:00:26,340
But that means nobody else can actually access this website,
5

6
00:00:26,700 --> 00:00:28,440
which makes it a bit pointless, right?
6

7
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:32,370
The whole point of a website is so that we could put it onto the internet and
7

8
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:35,760
everybody will be able to see our personal site or our CV.
8

9
00:00:36,330 --> 00:00:39,240
So how can we do this? Well, in order to do that,
9

10
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:41,430
we need to host our website somewhere.
10

11
00:00:42,750 --> 00:00:47,750
Now there's a whole bunch of hosting sites such as GoDaddy or Bluehost,
11

12
00:00:48,330 --> 00:00:52,050
but because we're learning at the moment, we don't want to have to pay for this.
12

13
00:00:52,110 --> 00:00:54,630
So there's also a free solution that
13

14
00:00:54,660 --> 00:00:57,540
I'm going to show you. By the end of this lesson,
14

15
00:00:57,540 --> 00:01:01,440
you are going to have your personal CV up on the internet
15

16
00:01:01,830 --> 00:01:03,240
proudly displayed somewhere,
16

17
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:08,300
and you'll be able to share a URL or a link to it so that anybody across the web
17

18
00:01:08,670 --> 00:01:09,870
can be able to access it.
18

19
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:13,830
But, first things first, we'll need to do a little bit of setup.
19

20
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:18,510
The service that we're going to use is GitHub. And we're going to talk about
20

21
00:01:18,510 --> 00:01:23,070
GitHub in a lot of detail a little bit later on. It's a really,
21

22
00:01:23,070 --> 00:01:27,570
really useful tool that is pretty much essential to a developer's workflow.
22

23
00:01:28,230 --> 00:01:31,290
But for now we're only gonna use one of its features,
23

24
00:01:31,350 --> 00:01:35,460
which is hosting our website. So first and foremost,
24

25
00:01:35,490 --> 00:01:39,750
if you don't have a GitHub account, then you'll need to set up a new one.
25

26
00:01:40,260 --> 00:01:43,050
So I'm just going to set one up while we're at it.
26

27
00:01:44,220 --> 00:01:48,510
And now it'll ask you to choose a plan. Now we're gonna choose the free plan,
27

28
00:01:49,710 --> 00:01:51,420
and then we then click continue.
28

29
00:01:52,290 --> 00:01:56,970
Now I'm going to skip this questionnaire and just click on skip this step. Now,
29

30
00:01:56,970 --> 00:01:58,980
once you have signed up to GitHub,
30

31
00:01:59,310 --> 00:02:03,540
it's really important that you go ahead and verify your email address.
31

32
00:02:03,630 --> 00:02:08,190
So check your emails and see if you have something from GitHub and then click
32

33
00:02:08,220 --> 00:02:11,040
on that verify link. And once you've done that,
33

34
00:02:11,070 --> 00:02:14,160
you'll be able to add new repositories to GitHub.
34

35
00:02:14,670 --> 00:02:17,970
If you head over to the upper right corner and just click on the plus button,
35

36
00:02:18,540 --> 00:02:23,100
and then we're going to create a new repository. This repository,
36

37
00:02:23,130 --> 00:02:24,780
I'm just going to call it cv
37

38
00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:29,900
and this is going to be the name of my project. And all that a repository is it's
38

39
00:02:30,060 --> 00:02:32,910
simply just a folder out there on the cloud
39

40
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:37,110
that's going to store all of your project-related files and you'll be able to
40

41
00:02:37,110 --> 00:02:40,470
make changes to the files and update the files
41

42
00:02:40,710 --> 00:02:44,190
and you'll be able to track all of those changes that you've made in the past.
42

43
00:02:44,910 --> 00:02:47,370
Now that we've given our repository a name,
43

44
00:02:47,580 --> 00:02:50,610
then we're going to leave the description as empty
44

45
00:02:50,910 --> 00:02:54,120
and then we're going to keep public selected. And then down here,
45

46
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:58,890
make sure that you check this box where we initialize this repository with a
46

47
00:02:58,900 --> 00:03:01,210
readme. And it's really,
47

48
00:03:01,210 --> 00:03:04,300
really important that you do this for the next few steps to work.
48

49
00:03:04,690 --> 00:03:06,280
So now that we've done all of that,
49

50
00:03:06,310 --> 00:03:09,310
we're going to go ahead and click on create repository.
50

51
00:03:11,050 --> 00:03:13,420
And this will take just a moment.
51

52
00:03:13,540 --> 00:03:15,820
And now you should see a page that looks like this
52

53
00:03:16,030 --> 00:03:18,220
which means that your repository has been created.
53

54
00:03:18,700 --> 00:03:22,690
And the only file that's in your repository is just a readme file.
54

55
00:03:23,140 --> 00:03:27,670
What we're going to do is we're going to go ahead and upload our files for our
55

56
00:03:27,670 --> 00:03:31,240
CV website. So now if you bring up the folder
56

57
00:03:31,450 --> 00:03:34,030
which contains your CV website,
57

58
00:03:34,270 --> 00:03:38,410
so the place where you see your index.html, your images folder,
58

59
00:03:38,770 --> 00:03:42,310
and any other pages you have, you're going to select all of these
59

60
00:03:42,430 --> 00:03:45,280
and you're going to drag it into this box here.
60

61
00:03:45,820 --> 00:03:50,080
And that will upload and add all of them to our online repository.
61

62
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:55,090
Once that's done, we're going to give this particular version a name.
62

63
00:03:55,390 --> 00:03:57,280
So we'll say that in this version,
63

64
00:03:57,310 --> 00:04:02,310
we added a initial CV website files.
64

65
00:04:03,700 --> 00:04:07,540
And then make sure that this part where it says commit directly to the master
65

66
00:04:07,540 --> 00:04:09,130
branch is checked,
66

67
00:04:09,550 --> 00:04:12,580
and then go ahead and click to commit these changes.
67

68
00:04:13,180 --> 00:04:17,560
And that will upload all of those files that we dragged on
68

69
00:04:17,980 --> 00:04:20,910
and we are now ready to set up our GitHub page.
69

70
00:04:22,770 --> 00:04:25,920
If you head over to the settings tab here
70

71
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:29,820
and if you scroll down on the settings page,
71

72
00:04:30,180 --> 00:04:35,130
you will see that there is a section called GitHub pages and GitHub pages is
72

73
00:04:35,130 --> 00:04:40,130
designed to host your personal organization or project pages from a GitHub
73

74
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:43,350
repository. So, we already have the repository.
74

75
00:04:43,650 --> 00:04:47,700
We now have to activate our pages. So it's currently disabled.
75

76
00:04:47,790 --> 00:04:49,650
All we have to do to enable it
76

77
00:04:49,710 --> 00:04:53,070
we just have to select a source where our files reside.
77

78
00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:55,500
So if you click on this part where it says none,
78

79
00:04:55,830 --> 00:04:58,710
you should change it to where it says master branch.
79

80
00:04:59,430 --> 00:05:01,470
And go ahead and click save.
80

81
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:06,000
So now GitHub is going to do some behind the scenes stuff
81

82
00:05:06,390 --> 00:05:10,560
and it's going to be publishing towards a place which is going to be your
82

83
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:14,670
username.github.io/your project name.
83

84
00:05:14,940 --> 00:05:19,470
So that will be your CV. And you can see this is a HTTPS website,
84

85
00:05:19,740 --> 00:05:24,510
so you'll be able to access the site from anywhere across the world,
85

86
00:05:24,570 --> 00:05:26,370
as long as you're connected to the internet.
86

87
00:05:27,090 --> 00:05:29,940
Now this publishing process takes a little while.
87

88
00:05:29,970 --> 00:05:32,400
So if you refresh this page,
88

89
00:05:32,820 --> 00:05:36,600
you'll see that it says your site is published at this address.
89

90
00:05:36,930 --> 00:05:38,340
And if you click on that address,
90

91
00:05:38,610 --> 00:05:43,140
you should be able to see your website show up. Now, if at this point what
91

92
00:05:43,380 --> 00:05:45,540
you see instead is a 404,
92

93
00:05:45,900 --> 00:05:49,260
then that just means that you have to be a little bit more patient. Um,
93

94
00:05:49,290 --> 00:05:54,120
the GitHub servers are probably working overtime and come back in maybe half an
94

95
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:58,730
hour and check that link again. But once you are done though,
95

96
00:05:58,760 --> 00:06:02,810
then your website should work exactly as it did locally.
96

97
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:07,640
But now you can go ahead and share this link with anybody you like across the
97

98
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:12,500
world and they can access it because it's now hosted on the internet.
98

99
00:06:13,010 --> 00:06:17,990
So you can go ahead and go over to angelabauer.github.io/cv
99

100
00:06:18,230 --> 00:06:21,500
and you too will be able to see this website that I just uploaded
100

101
00:06:21,650 --> 00:06:23,000
and I'm looking at right now.
101

102
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:28,600
So now it's time for you to go through this process and upload your CV and your
102

103
00:06:28,970 --> 00:06:30,980
website onto the world wide web
103

104
00:06:31,130 --> 00:06:36,080
and be sure to share a link to your project in the Q/A of this lesson so
104

105
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:39,830
that we can all admire your hard work and what you have created.
105

106
00:06:40,430 --> 00:06:43,400
So that's all from me for this lesson. I'll see you on the next.

00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:05,120
So now that we've got books and teaching or education and work experience listed
1

2
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:06,720
in chronological order,
2

3
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:11,490
the next thing that might be nice to add are listing some of the skills that you
3

4
00:00:11,490 --> 00:00:12,300
have.
4

5
00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:17,300
So I want you, as a challenge, to create a table where you've got an h3 for
5

6
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:21,180
the skills subtitle,
6

7
00:00:21,660 --> 00:00:26,660
and then you've got all your skills listed in a column on the left, and on the
7

8
00:00:27,030 --> 00:00:27,630
right
8

9
00:00:27,630 --> 00:00:32,630
you've got some rows where you've listed using emojis to show how familiar you
9

10
00:00:33,900 --> 00:00:38,430
are with each skill ranging from 5 star to 1 star.
10

11
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,050
Once you're done,
11

12
00:00:40,110 --> 00:00:44,040
you should have a website that looks something like this.
12

13
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:47,010
So you've got your h3 as a subtitle,
13

14
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:49,920
and then you've got a table that lists your skills
14

15
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:52,650
as well as the number of stars that you would rate yourself.
15

16
00:00:52,980 --> 00:00:54,150
And to get bonus points,
16

17
00:00:54,180 --> 00:00:58,200
you can also use tables to affect the layout of your skills.
17

18
00:00:58,260 --> 00:01:03,150
So you end up separating your skills into two columns and making it look a
18

19
00:01:03,150 --> 00:01:07,620
little bit like this. And this is what you should end up with or rather
19

20
00:01:07,620 --> 00:01:09,330
this is what you're aiming for.
20

21
00:01:09,390 --> 00:01:14,010
So I've added an extra skill so that we have four skills and they are laid out
21

22
00:01:14,010 --> 00:01:15,480
side by side
22

23
00:01:15,690 --> 00:01:19,170
so that there's two columns of these skill sets.
23

24
00:01:19,590 --> 00:01:24,590
And it's really important to note that these two sections should be distinct from
24

25
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:28,620
each other. So if you added a one pixel border,
25

26
00:01:28,980 --> 00:01:33,980
this is the structure that you will see. Two sets of skills side-by-side, distinct
26

27
00:01:34,470 --> 00:01:37,020
from each other. So if you want to give that challenge a go
27

28
00:01:37,060 --> 00:01:40,500
then this is a good time to pause the video and give it a try.
28

29
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:40,970
<v 1>Go on. </v>
